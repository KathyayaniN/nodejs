                              ################# NODE JS INTRODUCTION #####################
        
     Node js is server side platform which build on Google Chrome Java Script V8 Engine(Every browser needs a compiler so in chrome we
     have v8 engine to compile....)
    
    Definition: It use runtime(?) environment and non blocking i.e., wastes no time and resources for waiting I/O response and 
                event driven(Event Mechanisum that is event loop)
                These things makes node js as lightweight(?) and efficient By using node js we can build easily scalable and 
                fast network applications.
  
                  ####################### POINTS TO KNOW ABOUT NODE JS ###########################
                  
    Node is open source and cross platform to develop on server side 
    Node is not a framework but express is a framework
    Node is server side JavaScript environment 
    Node js written in c++ and it works with v8 engine
    Node provides rich liabraries of javascript modules which simplifies the development of web applications to great extent  
    Node js converts Java Script to Machine Language 
  
      NODE JS                                           PHP
   1. it's faster than php                      1. it's easy to pick this language
   2. it's more extensive than php              2. few lines of code
   3. asynchronous                              3. synchronous
  
    NOTE: Advantage of node js you can use on both front end and backend 
         ** extensive: covering large area
         
                    ######################## FEATURES OF NODE JS ###################################
               
       1. Asynchronous : It wont waste time for I/O response
       
       2. Very Fast : Node is very fast in code execution
       
       3. Single Thread but Highly Scalable: By using event mechanism it handles large number of requests 
       
              
              
                    ####################### WHERE TO USE NODE JS ####################################
                    
         1. I/O applications
         2. Single page applications
         3. JSON data based applications 
         
        Note: For CPU applications its not adviseable
